# GeneticAlgorithmP5

A simple genetic algorithm using P5js

Goal of evolution is to reach a target with multiple barriers in the way

Runs iterations based on 400 frames

Fitness is calculated based on best range and/or reaching of target

DNA is crossed-over and mutated naturally and added to a mating pool for the next generation
